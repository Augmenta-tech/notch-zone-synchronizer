# notch-zone-synchronizer
Notch plugin for Augmenta zone synchronization
Creates and updates all Augmenta zones as 3D shapes nodes in Notch.

When manually triggered this plugin does :
- Fetch the zones from Augmenta server's json
- Create/update the 3D shapes

## Install

Requirement
- Notch license (at least student, if you need to save the patch)
- Augmenta OSC remote control enabled

Get the provided example or follow this instructions to make it work from a blank notch project 

- Create a Javascript node and rename it
- On the node inspector : Add Global Input (float) and rename it to "SyncZones"
- On the node inspector : Add 2x Global Input (string) and rename it to "RemoteAddress" and "RemotePort"
- On the node inspector : Add 1x Global Input (string) and rename it to "WorldName", the WorldName parameter is the name of the plÃ©iades world without spaces or capital letters (for example "My World" would be "myWorld")
- On the node inspector : Add 2x Global Input (string) and rename it to "AugmentaScriptNodeName" and "SceneName", the AugmentaScriptNodeName must have the same name as the Javascript node and put a name to the scene
- In project > settings > protocols, enable osc and TUIO (in case you need it)

N.B : If you create several javascript nodes, you must give a different name to the Javascript node (and AugmentaScriptNodeName) and to the SceneName.

## Use

This prototype is only synchronizing one box zone that should be named testZone in Augmenta

Fill RemoteAddress with the Augmenta server address and RemotePort with the port

Triggering options
- Manually in the patch by changing the SyncZones value
- Osc (through and OSC modifier) (not tested)
- key pressed 'r' at runtime (not tested)

In Notch patch, press ctrl+R on the "Augmenta zones" node to see all the zones displayed
